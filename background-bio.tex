\section{Biological background}
\label{sec:biol-backgr}

-disease states and bio cond are character by distinct gene expression (DeRisis 1997; spellman 1998; Eisen and Brown
1999; Brown Botstein 1999)

\subsection{RNA sequencing}
\label{sec:rna-sequencing}

Ever since the mid to late nineties the importance of expression of individual genes in determining biological condition
and {\color{red} likelihood of} disease. Until recently the most prevalent method for obtaining
