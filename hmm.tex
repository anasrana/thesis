\section{Markov Models}

We consider a Markov Chain in continuous time and discrete state space with states $k=\{1, \ldots, K\}$. A continuous time Markov Chain is less sensitive to missing time points and in fact does not require any special treatment. The other advantage is that we get a closed form solution.

A Hidden Markov Model is used in many biological systems to describe
