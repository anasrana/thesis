This thesis is multidisciplinary and as such requires an introduction to multiple distinct areas. In this chapter we set out a description of background material which should prove useful to a reader with expertise in only one of the ares. The current chapter is therefore split into three self-contained sections covering the individual areas. First Section \ref{sec:math-backgr} includes mathematical background for the main techniques used in the thesis and introduces additional ideas that might place the work in broader context. Section \ref{sec:biol-backgr} contains some background to the main biological ideas discussed. Finally in Section \ref{sec:exper-backgr} the experimental techniques to obtain the data used in this work are outlined.
