This thesis is multidisciplinary and as such requires an introduction to multiple distinct areas. In this Chapter we set out a description of background material, which should prove useful to a reader with expertise in only one of the areas. The current Chapter is therefore also split into three self-contained sections covering the individual areas. First, Section \ref{sec:math-backgr} includes mathematical background for the main techniques used in the thesis and introduces additional ideas that might place the work in broader context. Then, Section \ref{sec:biol-backgr} contains some background to the main biological ideas discussed. Finally, in Section \ref{sec:exper-backgr} the experimental techniques to obtain the data used in this work are outlined.
