Here we set out a description of background material which should prove useful to the reader. This is thesis is multidisciplinary and as such requires an introduction to two distinct areas. Therefore this chapter is split into two separate sections. First the Section \ref{sec:math-backgr} includes a mathematical background for the main techniques used in the thesis {\color{red} and some important ideas}. Section \ref{sec:biol-backgr} contains some background to the main Biological ideas discussed in the thesis.
