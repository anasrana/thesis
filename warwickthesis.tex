% warwickthesis.tex modified by M Hadley from utthesis.doc  Sept 96
% Significant changes were made in 2009, first to work seemlessly with pdflatex
% and secondly to use the setspace package to control linespacing -
% removing some incompatibilities that existed before.

%%% This file contains a template that can be used with the package
%%% utthesis.sty and LaTeX2e to produce a thesis that meets the requirements
%%% of the Graduate School of The University of Texas at Austin.
%%%
%%% All of the commands defined by utthesis.sty have default values (see
%%% the file
%           warwickthesis.sty
%%%                        for these values).  Thus, theoretically, you
%%% don't need to define values for any of them; you can run this file
%%% through LaTeX2e and produce an acceptable thesis, without any text.
%%% However, you probably want to set at least some of the macros (like
%%% \thesisauthor).  In that case, replace "..." with appropriate values,
%%% and uncomment the line (by removing the leading %'s).
