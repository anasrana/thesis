    \caption{Simulation study. Extend figure \ref{fig:dupl-realistic} to include a wider range of doubling rate. The top
left panel shows the correlations between true and estimated $\beta_{kj}$ as a function of death rates. The bottom left
panel shows the mean differences between estimated and true probabilities averaged over $10$ trajectories as a solid
line and the shaded area represents the standard deviation.Different panels show a range of doubling rates. The
remaining panels show boxplots for the estimated average transition times the horizontal dashed line shows the true
values used in estimation. }
