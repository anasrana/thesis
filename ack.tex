Writing the acknowledgements is quite challenging to write as I want express my gratitude to everyone who has helped shape my work and life over the year. Hence before I start my sincerest apologies to anyone I missed out anyone by name.

Most importantly I would like to thank God for increasing my faculties and giving me the strength to finalise this work. Without his help I would not be where I am now as a person and in my research.

I also owe a debt of gratitude to \emph{Huzoor}, Hadhrat Mirza Masroor Ahmad (atba), for his invaluable guidance, he has always been a source of strength and a guide in my life.

My parents have been a great inspiration and driving force for me.  I will be eternally grateful for the sacrifices that especially my mother made to ensure we (her children)  have all the opportunities in life she never did. It is for her benefit that I have included a translation of these Acknowledgements in Urdu.
